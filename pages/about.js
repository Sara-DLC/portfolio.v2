    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi! I am Sara De La Cruz a Software Engineer interested in open source and volunteering my free time to help non-profits build better software systems to help our communities. On my free time I like to watch documentaries, learn a new skill, or simply just laze around and listen to music. If you would like to know anything else please feel free to ask 😁</p>
